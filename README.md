# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Background
A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

1. Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
	* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg 	of MechaCar prototypes

	* Question 1: Which variables/coefficients provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in 	the dataset?

	- Methodology: Each Pr(>|t|) value in the summary above represents the probability that each coefficient 	contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model.

	- Answer: The car's length and ground clearance have a significant impact on mpg.

2. Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
	* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the 	manufacturing lots


3. Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
	* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean 	population


4. Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
	* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles 	from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the 	findings.
